Broadcast System Architecture

    for ex.

    N2 <--> N1 <--> N3

    #Core functions
    
    #Broadcast
    #One node receives message to "broadcast" a certain value to other nodes
    
    #Read
    #One node receives message to "read" and it has to send back all of the values
    #that it's been broadcasted by other nodes

    #Topology
    #One nodes (or more nodes) receive "topology" that explains what the neighboring nodes
    #of each node are
